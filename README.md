This is a prove of concept prototype of software that finds an optimal building that fits all defined constraints.

## How to run

To run the prototype you need to have Erlang installed on your computer.

erl> mcmc:run(X,Y,N).

X, Y - the width and length of the building
N - the number of iteration of MCMC algorithm
